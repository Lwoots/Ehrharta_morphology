## Ehrharta morphology methods

Trait measurments for four individuals per population in the high elevation clades were taken, unless a given population had fewer flowering individuals. Only one individual for the low-elevation clades was phenotyped. Where possible, individuals were corresponding to the phylogeny tips were selected, although occasionally another individual had to be substituted in if the original individual was not in flower.



Notes:

* For _E. microlaena_ a herbarium specimen from the same locality was used, as our vouchers were under-developed. Verboom 695
* All measurements are in mm.
* M7 and 1594-2 are the same individual.
* Spikelet length inclues awns



## Traits measured



- Plant height - distance from rhizome to inflorescence tip.
- Vegetation height - distance from rhizome to second highest leaf (ie excluding flag leaf)
- Leaf width -  width at the widest point of the leaf
- Leaf length - sheath to tip
- Sheath length
