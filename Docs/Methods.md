## Ehrharta morphology methods

Trait measurments for four individuals per population in the high elevation clades were taken, unless a given population had fewer flowering individuals. Only one individual for the low-elevation clades was phenotyped. Where possible, individuals were corresponding to the phylogeny tips were selected, although occasionally another individual had to be substituted in if the original individual was not in flower.



Notes:

* For _E. microlaena_ a herbarium specimen from the same locality was used, as our vouchers were under-developed. Verboom 695
* All measurements are in mm, except for pedicel, glume, lemma and spikelet length/width measures. They are measured in tenths of mm. ie 10 epu = 1mm. 
* M7 and 1594-2 are the same individual.
* Spikelet length inclues awns
* Leaf length, width, and sheath length all measured for the same leaf.



## Traits measured



- Plant height - distance from rhizome to inflorescence tip.
- Vegetation height - distance from rhizome to second highest leaf (ie excluding flag leaf)
- Leaf width -  width at the widest point of the leaf
- Leaf length - sheath to tip
- Sheath length 
- Leaf roll - 0 = leaf blade flat, 1 = leaf blade rolled, 2 = leaf blade folded.
- Leaf dry - 0 = majority of leaves fresh at time of collection, 1 = majority of leaves dry at time of collection.
- Internode distance - measured in lowest 3rd of specimen, unless other internodes judged more representative.
- Culm diameter - measured in lowest 3rd of specimen.
- Inflorescence length
- Spikelet number - count of spikelets in a representative inflorescence.
- Pedicel length
- Glume length outer - length from base of spikelet to tip outer glume.
- Glume length inner - length from base of spikelet to tip inner glume.
- Spikelet width - measured a third of the way up the spikelet, just before the glumes flare. Glumes are included, except for spp. such as tricostata where the glumes are reduced.
- Spikelet length - from base of spikelet to the tip of whichever lemma was the longest.
- Lemma length outer - from base of spikelet with glumes removed, to tip of outer lemma.
- Lemma length inner - from base of spikelet with glumes removed, to tip of inner lemma.
- Striation no - count of striations on inner lemma.
- Lemma tip - 0 = rounded or flat, 1 = awned, 2 = canoe.
- Hair tuft - 0 = no hair tuft present, 1 = hair tuft present at base of lemma.
